This SO-DIMM card essentially let's you turn a CM5 into a NVIDIA Jetson card, turing RK1, and other compatible SO-DIMM standards! It's going to be used for my future server clutser motherboard!
## Custom Features!
- Jetson/Turing RK1/Radxa/etc compatible SO-DIMM connector
- Support for SD Card mounting
- GbE Ethernet

## PCB Design

The CM5 SO-DIMM carrier is a complex 6-layer PCB, with the stackup HIGH-SPEED/GND/SIGNAL/SIGNAL/GND/HIGH-SPEED, with power running along the top layer! You can easily access the schematic [here](https://github.com/KaiPereira/CM5-SODIMM-Carrier/blob/master/PCB_CARRIER/carrier.pdf)!
