# 8-Node ITX Cluster Board

I'm working on an 8-node ITX cluster board with support for the NVIDIA Jetson compute module, turing RK1, and CM5/CM4.

I'm also making custom daughter boards for the CM4/CM5 that support NVMe SSD, and a bunch of other stuff, with SODIMM pinout compatibility with many of thr NVIDIA Jetson models
